## LongQC

A Workflow for long read preprocessing and quality control. It's composed of:

- [NanoPlot](https://github.com/wdecoster/NanoPlot) [^1] for creating visualizations of read quality before **and**
  after processing.
- [PoreChop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop) for trimming sequence adapters
- [FiltLong](https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong) for low-quality filtering and other preprocessing.
